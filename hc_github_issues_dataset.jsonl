{"prompt": "Multiple Inventories for Different Purposes", "completion": "From our ALA colleagues: 'In analysing the extension model we identified three possible uses of inventories:\r\nStatements of intention. This is the scope of what the activity is intended to cover.\r\nStatements of actuality. This is the scope of what the activity has actually covered, based on comparison with a statement of intention.\r\nStatements of description. This is the scope of the data collected.\r\n\r\nThe current Humboldt extension appears to link statements of intention and actuality into a single record. Term names reflect this, with **targetTaxonomicScope**, rather than **taxonomicScope**.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, it is hard to determine whether the term refers to an intention or an actual result. For example **eventDuration** could mean either the intended duration or the actual duration taken.\r\n\r\nWe propose a different way of structuring inventories, with **inventoryType** describing the intended purpose of the inventory. This would involve the following changes: (1) Terms such as **targetTaxonomicScope** would be renamed **taxonomicScope**. Whether the scope is a target, measure of completeness or a description would be dependent on the inventory type. (2) Completeness inventories and description inventories can be linked to target inventories by use of a **targetInventoryID** using the **inventoryID** discussed above.\r\n\r\nThe changes proposed would allow the presence of descriptive inventories without ambiguity. It would also allow a cleared relationship between intention and actuality; terms such as **hasVouchers** can either represent the intention to collect vouchers or the fact that voucher specimens have been collected.'"}
{"prompt": "Lack of Identifiers and Semantic Interoperability", "completion": "Feedback from our ALA colleagues: 'Within the general Darwin Core structure there is a tendency to allow an identifier to be associated with a more general textual term. For example, **datasetName** and **datasetID** from Darwin Core or **measurementType** and **measurementTypeID** from the extended measurement or fact extension. The **measurementType** would contain a string such as \u201carea\u201d and **measurementTypeID** would contain the URI \u201chttp://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P24/current/AREA/\u201d. If a description can be unambiguously associated with a semantic URI, the inventory can be used by machines to aid search and discovery. A resolvable URI also aids user comprehension since it allows a user to locate additional contextual information about a term. As a general principle, any term that is associated with a formal vocabulary should have an associated ID-term. For example, **identifierTypes** and **identifierTypeID** Similarly, anything that might reference an external definition should also have an associated ID-term that can be used to locate a formal description of the definition. For example, **samplingEffortProtocol** and **samplingEffortProtocolID**.'"}
