In search queries, it can be desirable to target (or exclude) animal sounds that occur within specific frequency ranges. The current proposal intends to adopt the terms \"Filter HP\" and \"Filter LP\" terms from [GUANO](https://github.com/riggsd/guano-spec/blob/master/guano_specification.md) (originally discussed in #247), which currently have no corresponding terms in avcore.\r\n\r\nNote: filterLP and filterHP can be used independently or together.\r\n\r\nNote: GUANO uses kHz as units, whereas [Audiovisual Core uses Hz in ac:freqLow and ac:freqHigh](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues/178). Hz is proposed here for self-consistency, though it would make the mapping to GUANO slightly more complex than a pure identity mapping.\r\n\r\nNote: This is proposed as a new term rather than an import because GUANO is not a namespaced standard.

{"prompt": "Implementation of subjectPart and subjectOrientation in Myriatrix", "completion": \r\nPlaceholder issue for a test implementation of relevant Audiovisual Core Terms `subjectPart` and `subjectOrientation` in the Myriatrix Scratchpad.\r\n**Issue open to comments:** Yes. [This may change when/if extensive (re)writing is needed]\r\n[subjectPart terms](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/blob/master/docs/part/index.md) comments: Complete.\r\n[subjectOrientation terms](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/blob/master/docs/orient/index.md) comments: Complete.\r\n\r\nIn this use case report, the contributing tester documents limitations to the implementation of the current features of the Audiovisual Core `subjectPart` and `subjectOrientation` vocabularies as Drupal vocabularies in the [Myriatrix](https://myriatrix.myspecies.info/) Scratchpad as per Baskauf _et al._ (2023). Software development is beyond the scope of the tester but CMS development is in scope.\r\nIt should be noted that Scratchpads 2.0 comes with three default vocabularies for images: 1) Image keywords (free entry), and 2) Imaging technique and 3) Preparation technique, drawn from a restricted vocabulary defined within the Scratchpad that can be augmented by the user (see Smith _et al._, 2009). In the absence of controlled `subjectPart` and `subjectOrientation` vocabularies, Scratchpads can handle relevant image tagging through the image keyword vocabulary.\r\nIt is not possible to define regions of interest in images in Scratchpads. One basic approach to partly address this limitation is to implement subjectPart tagging as multiple tags. The best way to achieve this in Myriatrix is to create a \"Subject part\" field, allowing multiple comma-separated values, and drawing from the Morphology glossary to autocomplete the terms while typing.\r\nThe Biodiversity Heritage Library did use regions of interest for applying image tags (BHL, 2012). It was done through Flickr and \"Box Tagging Multi-Species Images\" but it could technically be applied to more granular image regions. As limitations, 1) the region is always a box (rectangle), 2) tags in the form namespace:predicate=value are not developed for the potential BHL-Flickr `subjectPart` and `subjectOrientation` AC equivalents, and 3) even if image searching and tagging remain available, the BHL Flickr account is on hiatus due to staffing changes and the account is neither monitored nor new images are uploaded.\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n- [x] Make sure that all relevant subjectPart terms for centipedes are registered in the Morphology glossary (a Drupal vocabulary) of Myriatrix.\r\n- [x] Create a subjectOrientation Drupal vocabulary in Myriatrix, with all relevant orientation terms for centipedes.\r\n- [ ] Translate the labels and definitions into Spanish when the revisions are complete.\r\n- [ ] Fill in as per table 2 in Baskauf _et al._ (2023): Organization, Taxonomic coverage (centipedes), Number of images in test, Image type (is there an image type vocabulary?), Testing type (manual).\r\n- [ ] Test with literature images of recently published (e. g., 2020) new species.\r\n\r\n## General remarks\r\n1. The section \"1.2 RFC 2119 key words\" across `subjectPart` and `subjectOrientation` documents (and beyond) SHOULD be updated to \"The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) **and [RFC 8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174)**\". Also, note that the RFC documents are citable. Example: [RFC2119] Bradner, S., \"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels\", [BCP 14](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/bcp14), [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119), DOI 10.17487/RFC2119, March 1997, <http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc2119>.\r\n2. `subjectPart` terms can be reused from or implemented as morphological glossaries in databases. That is the case of the [Morphology glossary](https://myriatrix.myspecies.info/classification/14) in Myriatrix.\r\n3. The content of the `subjectPart` and `subjectOrientation` field \"Definition derived from:\" maps to the content of the Scratchpads field \"Ontology Term URL\". See Baker _et al._, (2019).\r\n4. The use of the `subjectPart` and `subjectOrientation` field \"Has broader concept\" (equivalent to an is_a relation) is acceptable for \"male cone\" and \"female cone\" (is_a cone), \"forewing\" and \"hindwing\" (is_a wing), \"foreleg\", \"midleg\", and \"hindleg\" (is_a leg), and \"right side\" and \"left side\" (is_a lateral side), but is counterintuitive for \"flower\" (part_of inflorescence), \"cranium\" and \"mandible\" (part_of skull), for which a field \"Part of concept\" may be better suited. In any case, the two meanings should not be mixed. Also note that, for consistency, \"wing\" and \"leg\" should have been created with a \"Has broader concept\" (part_of !!!) \"thorax\", and \"antenna\", \"eye\", and \"skull\" (when present) with a \"Has broader concept\" (part_of !!!) \"head\".\r\n5. It is recommended that in the [Controlled value strings from SKOS Collections for ac:subjectPartLiteral](https://ac.tdwg.org/part_collections) a consistent listing order is chosen for entireOrganism and unspecifiedPart. See also comment on unspecifiedWholeOrPart and entireOrganism (body, wholeOrganism) below. Tentative listing order: 1) unspecifiedWholeOrPart, 2) entireOrganism, 3) unspecifiedPart.\r\n6. `subjectOrientation` term definitions excessively rely on the word \"side\", apparently imported from ontologies like the BSPO and neglect two key points: 1) Views are **views from the point of the observer** and not directly related to specimen structures and the word \"view\" instead of \"side\" is meant to be used in many cases. \"Views\" from the point of the observer belong in `subjectOrientation` while \"sides\" are parts and belong in `subjectPart`. 2) The word \"side\" is applicable to the halves of a bilaterally symmetrical body as defined by the median/longitudinal/sagittal plane of symmetry and should not be used instead of the word \"end\" to describe the anterior/posterior or rostral/caudal or proximal/distal or basal/apical halves as defined by a transverse plane. \"Ends\" are also parts and do not belong in subjectOrientation but in `subjectPart`. Please, use bio-ontologies critically. Many of them contain quite remarkable mistakes and inconsistencies.\r\n7. It may be useful to start looking at [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) while compiling, maintaining, and translating TDWG vocabularies. It should be noted that the top noun in the WordNet hierarchy is \"entity\", which contrasts with `subjectPart` and `subjectOrientation` being concept schemes and their terms being concepts. Nevertheless, mapping of TDWG vocabulary terms to WordNet may prove useful, especially 1) while redacting term definitions and/or choosing among multiple definitions for one term, 2) for translating terms from English into [other languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordNet#Other_languages) by taking advantage of the standardization of wordnets and uniformity of wordnets synsets across human languages, 3) for connecting TDWG vocabulary terms to ontologies through existing mappings between the WordNet synsets and the categories from ontologies, and 4) for looking into WordNet relations whenever advanced SKOS relations are needed for modelling TDWG vocabularies and keeping both sets of relations mapped. More specifically for Audivisual Core, its vocabularies, and future machine classification applications, and eye should be kept on [ImageNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet), an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy of nouns.\r\n\r\n## Specific remarks\r\n\r\n### subjectPart terms\r\n\r\n**Non-applicable subjectPart terms:**\r\n1) All plant terms: bark, bud, female cone, flower, fruit, inflorescence, leaf, male cone, seed, stem, strobilis (cone), twig.\r\n2) Some animal terms: abdomen, cranium, fin, foreleg, forewing, hindleg, hindwing, midleg, shell, skull, thorax, wing.\r\n\r\n**Applicable subjectPart terms which will not/may not be implemented in Myriatrix:**\r\n1) **unspecified part (unspecifiedPart):** Hard to include it in an anatomical Drupal taxonomy in a way which makes sense. I have to give it a second thought. Also, note that this term implicitly assumes that there is a part, but implicit term hierarchy and usage also includes it being applicable to images which would contain an \"entire organism\". The implicit meaning and intended usage are better conveyed by a term unspecifiedWholeOrPart. Having the two terms would be perfect for machine-assisted applications.\r\n2) **genitalia (genitalia):** 1) The term may work well for a few animal groups in which the structures may be continuous and unique, continuous and paired, or discontinuous but a single pair. It will not work so well for discontinuous paired structures in more than one pair, and/or a combination of unique and paired structures across multiple segments. For arthropods, having a term such as genital segment(s) may work better than genitalia in some cases, as segments and their appendages are continuous [anatomical structures](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000061) which are captured along with [disconnected anatomical groups](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0034923) (paired gonopods, paired cerci, penis, ovipositor, etc.). 2) The addition of the word \"outer\" to the definition does not benefit its broader application, as in some groups the genitalia is internal and needs to be dissected and mounted in microscopic preparations (microslides) that will later be photographed or scanned. 2) The definition could be improved by changing the expression \"sex organ\" to \"reproductive organ\". \"Sex\" suggests copula, while genital structures such as the ovipositor are for egg-laying. For centipedes, the term genital segment(s) is preferred to genitalia and already [implemented in Myriatrix](https://myriatrix.myspecies.info/nontaxonomy/term/39196) but not yet in the ChilAO.\r\n\r\n**Applicable subjectPart terms with incompatible definitions:**\r\n1) **mandible (mandible):** The definition \"A dentary bone that is the only bone in one of the lateral halves of the lower jaw\" may work for humans/mammals/vertebrates but it does not work for animals which do not have bones/endoskeleton. The current definition for \"mandible\" in Chilopoda is \"one appendage of the first pair of the mouth-parts\", which should be probably improved to \"one appendage of the first pair of gnathal appendages\". Term already [implemented in Myriatrix](https://myriatrix.myspecies.info/nontaxonomy/term/38687) and in the ChilAO.\r\n2) **egg (egg):** 1) This term does not belong in the `subjectPart` vocabulary but in the [AC Taxonomic Coverage Vocabulary](https://ac.tdwg.org/termlist/#77-taxonomic-coverage-vocabulary), where the term `dwc:lifeStage` and the example \"egg\" are already included. 2) Also in Scratchpads, in the Specimen/Observation content type, the field \"Lifestage\" (sic!) displays the suggestion \"The age class or life stage of the biological individual represented by the catalogued object or observation. Examples: \"adult\", \"mature\", \"juvenile\", \"eft\", \"nymph\", \"seedling\", \"seed\", \"egg\". A controlled Scratchpads vocabulary does not exist, but if developed it would be applicable to both specimens and images. 3) The definition \"The hard-shelled reproductive body produced by an animal\" leaves out animal groups which produce eggs without a shell, e. g., arthropods, molluscs, fishes, amphibians, mammals. 4) The word \"body\" mentioned in the definition of \"egg\" should be changed to \"structure\" (or similar word) to avoid ambiguity with the word \"body\" mentioned in other three definitions (see point 4 in **entire organism**). In the definition, it could be made explicit that the egg is considered a life stage. The term \"egg\" will not be implemented in the Morphology glossary of Myriatrix and implementing a controlled lifeStage vocabulary is not planned at the moment.\r\n\r\n**Future subjectPart terms with incompatible definitions:**\r\n1) **trunk (trunk):** Not yet a term, but if added as it \"should\" (see Baskauf _et al._, 2023, table 3), then as a plant term its definition will conflict with the definition(s) of trunk as an animal term. This term is required for higher-rank groups such as Myriapoda (a subphylum) and Onychophora (a phylum) and the term itself is high in the anatomical hierarchy, e. g., it is a direct children of \"body\". Term \"trunk\" already [implemented in Myriatrix](https://myriatrix.myspecies.info/nontaxonomy/term/38680).\r\n\"Trunk\" is a term explicitly mentioned by Lucking _et al._ (2021), who were focused on multiple annotation of words: \"With regard to the word-level, mapping a single term to more than one annotation category could prove helpful (...) to resolve ambiguities (trunk as an anatomical feature of an animal or a plant). Thus, by assigning both annotation categories `MORPHOLOGY` and `PLANT`, the term trunk can be clearly identified as a plant characteristic.\" The same applies to annotation of images. Disambiguating \"trunk\" in image annotation should not be difficult as long as multiple annotation is used.\r\n\r\n**Observations on relevant subjectPart terms:**\r\n1) **entire organism (entireOrganism):** There is more than one issue here. 1) Note that wholeOrganism sounds more natural than entireOrganism, and it would also be more consistent with an unspecifiedWholeOrPart term (see above). The notion of a \"whole organism\" is also present in the definitions of the `subjectOrientation` terms \"right side\" and \"left side\" (it should also be in \"lateral side\" for consistency).  2) The term is intuitive, but \"organism\" is not really a term for anatomy and anatomical parts, at least in Zoology. For animals, the term \"body\" reflects the whole (e.g., anatomy of the human body, not the human organism). For an unicellular organism, the term \"cell\" may be enough. 3) An \"entire organism\" with the definition \"An entire multicellular organism\" neglects that an image of a unicellular organism also depicts an \"entire organism\". 4) The definition seems too much derived so as to cite [CARO_0000012 multicellular organism](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CARO_0000012) as the source and also raises the issue that CARO does include uni- and multicellular organisms under cellular organisms (e. g., entire organisms) while subjectPart does not. 5) Word \"body\" is mentioned in the definition of four terms: \"head\", \"thorax\", \"abdomen\", and \"fin\".\r\nIn Myriatrix, the term [\"body\" is the parent term of the Morphology glossary](https://myriatrix.myspecies.info/nontaxonomy/term/38678). For the time being and to test new fields, I linked it to the term [\"body\" in the Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology (HAO)](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HAO_0000182). The term \"body\" in HAO has a definition which excludes antennae, legs and wings. The HAO definition is not aligned with any WordNet \"body\" definition, a partial match being definition 5 (the body excluding the head and neck and limbs). The HAO definition is also not aligned with the all-inclusive definition that the term will have in the [Chilopoda Anatomy Ontology (ChilAO)](https://github.com/FID-Biodiversity/Ontologies/tree/main/chilao), which does match WordNet \"body\" definition 1 (the entire physical structure of an organism (an animal, plant, or human being)).\r\n\"Body\" is a term explicitly mentioned by Lucking _et al._ (2021) as one of the \"WordNet\u2019s 26 top-level entity categories (i.e., the unique beginner synset for nouns) for ontological classification\". I checked the [WordNet download page](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/download/current-version) and downloaded the [compressed file for WordNet 3.1](https://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/wn3.1.dict.tar.gz). 1) In the WordNet database that I downloaded, there are 26 \"noun.\" files, closely matching the list of 26 WordNet top-level entity categories mentioned by Lucking _et al._ (2021), e.g., 25 matches. There is one mismatch, it being the \"noun.Tops\" file in the database (that of course is not a category to be listed in the paper) and no noun.society file, while \"society\" is listed as one of the WordNet top categories in the paper. There is also no \"society\" entry in the \"noun.Tops\" file. 2) In the \"noun.Tops\" file that I downloaded there are not 26 but 51 \"top-level\" nouns, and like \"society\", the term \"body, corpus\" is not one of them. Looking into the \"noun.body\" file that I mentioned above, the term \"body\" is related to noun.Tops:natural_object and noun.Tops:animal, but that is all. This mismatch is of especial relevance, as biologists working on morphology ontologies, like myself, could rewrite from the paper something like \"The term \"body\" is one of the 26 WordNet top-level entity categories (Lucking et al., 2021), and therefore we chose it as the parent term for our taxonomy of morphological terms.\". Update: Dr. Andy Lucking provided a clarification on 23.06.2023, after consulting with colleagues: \"There was a strange kind of misunderstanding. I knew that the categories are those below noun.Tops. However, \"below\" did not refer to the noun.Tops index (which I assumed) but to the table in this documentation: https://wordnet.princeton.edu/documentation/lexnames5wn ! So its file number 04 to 28. For some reason \"society\" had been added, however...\". I replied that \"I checked the lexnames5wn list and I think that it may also explain why \"body\" was listed. Files 04 to 28 are noun files, and then... file 29 is verb.body! So it may be that the word made it into the main noun list of the article by means of consecutive association.\"\r\n\r\n2) **head (head):** The definition is \"Anterior-most division of the body\". The use of \"division\" restricts the definition and the word should be changed to \"region\" to keep \"head\" as broadly applicable as possible. Some organisms do not have a head visibly \"divided\" from the rest of the body. The addition of \"...frequently bearing structures such as eyes, antennae, and mouthparts\" to the definition may be useful, and there are related terms (eye, antenna, mandible) in subjectPart. Term already [implemented in Myriatrix](https://myriatrix.myspecies.info/nontaxonomy/term/38679).\r\n **Additional consistency remarks:** These remarks are based on head, thorax, and abdomen terms. 1) The previously addressed word \"division\" (head definition) is also present in the final, more consistent (than raw version) definitions of \"thorax\" and \"abdomen\", which previously used the word \"section\" (thorax definition) and the word \"tagma\" (abdomen definition, incorrect singular when plural was intended). As the two definitions are focused on insects, \"tagma/tagmata\" is the most correct word to use there, the word \"division\" would be fine but the word \"region\" would be best because it is also applicable to \"head\". 2) Regarding \"Anterior-most division\" (head definition), \"The middle division\" (thorax definition) and \"The posterior-most division\" (abdomen definition), note that A) adding \"The \" to the \"head\" definition would improve consistency, and B) whenever only two or three divisions/regions/tagmata are involved, using the suffix \"-most\" for \"anterior\" and \"posterior\" is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n3) **leg (leg):** No remarks at the moment. Term already [implemented in Myriatrix](https://myriatrix.myspecies.info/nontaxonomy/term/39158).\r\n\r\n4) **antenna (antenna):** No remarks at the moment. Term already [implemented in Myriatrix](https://myriatrix.myspecies.info/nontaxonomy/term/37297).\r\n\r\n5) **eye (eye):** No remarks at the moment. Term already [implemented in Myriatrix](https://myriatrix.myspecies.info/nontaxonomy/term/39190) but not yet in the ChilAO. Relevant terms for Chilopoda (centipedes) are [compound eye](https://myriatrix.myspecies.info/nontaxonomy/term/39192) and [ocellus](https://myriatrix.myspecies.info/nontaxonomy/term/37926) (plural ocelli).\r\n\r\n**Human-readable collection list of controlled value strings to be made available for centipedes in [subjectPart](https://ac.tdwg.org/part_collections)**\r\n\r\ncentipedes `https://ac.tdwg.org/part_collections#centipedes`\r\nAn effort was made to align the subjectPart vocabulary for centipedes with the higher-hierarchy structures used by Bonato _et al._ (2010): cephalic capsule, antenna, clypeus and labrum (as clypeolabrum), mandible, first maxillae (as the singular first maxilla), second maxilla (as the singular second maxilla), forcipular segment, leg-bearing segment, leg, ultimate leg-bearing segment, and terminal part of the body (as the singular genital segment). Terms which are not higher-hierarchy structures in but are listed by Bonato _et al._ (2010) include the appendage terms forcipule, ultimate leg, coxopleuron, and gonopod. Other terms not in Bonato _et al._ (2010) but important for the overall structure of the Morphology glossary in Myriatrix and for the centipedes subjectPart vocabulary include: head, eye, trunk, forcipular apparatus, and genital segment. All centipede appendages are included in this subjectPart vocabulary.\r\n\r\n- unspecifiedWholeOrPart\r\n- entireOrganism (body)\r\n- unspecifiedPart\r\n- head\r\n  - cephalic capsule\r\n  - antenna\r\n  - eye\r\n  - clypeolabrum\r\n  - mandible\r\n  - first maxilla\r\n  - second maxilla\r\n- trunk\r\n  - forcipular segment\r\n  - forcipular apparatus\r\n  - forcipule\r\n  - leg-bearing segment\r\n  - leg\r\n  - ultimate leg-bearing segment\r\n  - ultimate leg\r\n  - coxopleuron\r\n  - genital segment\r\n  - gonopod\r\n\r\n### subjectOrientation terms\r\n\r\n**Non-applicable subjectOrientation terms:**\r\n1) Plant terms: lower side, upper side.\r\n2) Cnidarian and echinoderm terms: aboral side, oral side.\r\n\r\n**Applicable subjectOrientation terms which will not/may not be implemented in Myriatrix:**\r\n1) **apical side (apical):** A part and not a view, an end and not a side.

{"prompt": "New term proposal: ac:Digital3DResource", "completion": "During the [2022-11-10 Audubon Core Maintenance Group working session](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/blob/master/historical/2022-11-10-working-session-notes.pdf) it was decided to propose minting an Audubon Core class term that could be used as a value for `dc:type`/`dcterms:type` when the subject resource was a digital 3D resource. We would then request that DataCite include it in their controlled vocabulary for `datacite:resourceTypeGeneral`. Because of potential issues with having a local name starting with a non-alphabetic character, the local name `Digital3DResource` was chosen over `3DDigitalResource`. The term metadata proposed here come from a [proposal submitted to the DCMI usage board](https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/105) that they chose not to act upon. See #243 for rationale and reasons why existing type terms are inadequate. At the working session, it was decided to fast-track this particular term addition in order to be able to start working towards getting it accepted by DataCite without needing to wait for completion of the entire 3D Task Group proposal. \r\n\r\nTerm name: ac:Digital3DResource\r\n\r\nLabel: Digital 3D Resource\r\n\r\nIRI: http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/terms/Digital3DResource\r\n\r\nControlled value string: Digital3DResource\r\n\r\nDefinition: One or more binary files primarily intended to hold information about the three-dimensional geometry (surface or volume) of a real or non-real object, set of objects, or scene.\r\n\r\nUsage: The term IRI should be used as a value for `dcterms:type` (<http://purl.org/dc/terms/type>). The controlled value string should be used as a value for `dc:type` (<http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/type>).\r\n\r\nNotes: Such files can be used by software to digitally render views of the subject, make measurements, conduct analyses, and create physical 3D replicas. This term includes resources composed of one or more files that are used to compute a 3D geometry (e.g., X-ray projections for computed tomography scans or photograph sets for photogrammetry). For avoidance of doubt, 2D renderings (views) produced from a Digital3DResource should not be included in this class, but stereo image pairs, anaglyphs, and other formats that hold information about 3D geometry may be included.\r\n\r\nType: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Class>\r\n\r\nSubmitted by @baskaufs on behalf of the [3D imagery and Data Task Group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/ac/3d/).\r\n"}
{"prompt": "Proposal to create a controlled vocabulary for content description", "completion": "This proposal is intended to help resolve several other open issues: #230 (Problems with Iptc4xmpExt:CVterm), #244 (Outdated Link in Notes for Iptc4xmpExt:CVterm), #200 (Term needed to designate when an image or ROI is a label), and #166 (View for \"in habitat\"). \r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\nDuring the development process of the subjectPart controlled vocabulary, the community was interested in providing a way to indicate that a particular image or region of interest within an image contained something that was not part of the organism. One [submitted use case](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/blob/master/views/submitted-use-cases.md#4-islabel) was to filter out images of labels. Another situation was to indicate that the photograph was of the habitat of the organism (either the organism wasn't in the habitat photo, or the organism was in the photo, but the entire organism was not the primary subject of the image -- the habitat was). Photos of scale bars and color scales would be similar to the label use case, and an audio analog would be to indication that a region of interest in the recording was a voice introduction. \r\n\r\nThe Task Group decided that these terms were out of scope for a vocabulary about subject parts, since they didn't actually involve any part of the organism. However, it recommended that the Audubon Core Maintenance Group consider other alternative methods to make it possible to filter for these features.\r\n\r\n**Proposal**\r\n\r\nCreate a Content Description controlled vocabulary. The concept IRIs would be used as values for `Iptc4xmpExt:CVterm` (defined as \"A term to describe the content of the image by a value from a Controlled Vocabulary\") and controlled value strings would be used as values for a newly minted term: `ac:CVtermLiteral` (defined below). \r\n\r\nIn the event that there were multiple values for `Iptc4xmpExt:CVterm`, the normal rules for serializing lists in that serialization would apply (e.g. RDF Turtle, JSON-LD). If there were multiple values for `ac:CVtermLiteral`, they MAY be concatenated and pipe separated if the user chose not to implement one of the methods described in [Section 3.2 (Tabular serializations) of the Audubon Core Structure guide](https://ac.tdwg.org/structure/#3-multiplicity-and-cardinality). \r\n\r\nThe revised definitions remove recommended vocabularies from the term metadata. If Audubon Core wishes to recommend vocabularies, it should do so via informative documents that do not require going through the standards process to change them. The URLs for many of the currently recommended vocabularies are broken (see Issue #244 for example) and others aren't actively maintained. The current recommendations are: the NASA Global Change Master Directory (GCMD; http://gcmd.nasa.gov/), Subject Categories defined in Key to Nature (K2N; http://www.keytonature.eu/wiki/Subject_Category), the BioComplexity Thesaurus; https://www2.usgs.gov/core_science_systems/csas/biocomplexity_thesaurus/, the Description Type GBIF Vocabulary; http://rs.gbif.org/vocabulary/gbif/description_type.xml, the TDWG Species Profile Model; http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems.rdf, the Plinian Core; https://github.com/tdwg/PlinianCore/wiki, the European Environmental Agency GEneral Multilingual Environmental Thesaurus (GEMET; http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet), and the Long Term Ecological Research Network Controlled Vocabulary (LTER; http://vocab.lternet.edu/).\r\n\r\nThe changes proposed here simplifies use of the terms. Either a globally unique IRI is used as a value for `Iptc4xmpExt:CVterm` (as IPTC expects), a controlled value string from the new AC Content Description vocabulary (initial values defined below) is used as a value for `ac:CVterm`, or a controlled value string for another vocabulary is used as a value for `ac:CVterm` and that vocabulary is identified using `ac:subjectCategoryVocabulary`.\r\n\r\n**Term revisions**\r\nNew text is in *italics*. Removed text is in ~strikethrough~. The definition of `Iptc4xmpExt:CVterm` remains unchanged from that given by the IPTC.\r\n\r\n**Term name:** Iptc4xmpExt:CVterm\r\n**Label:** Subject Category\r\n**IRI:** http://iptc.org/std/Iptc4xmpExt/2008-02-29/CVterm\r\n**Required:** No\r\n**Repeatable:** Yes\r\n**Definition:** A term to describe the content of the image by a value from a Controlled Vocabulary. \r\n**Usage:** *Values MUST be IRIs from a* controlled vocabulary of subjects to support broad classification of media items. *IRIs* ~Terms~ from *the Audubon Core Content Description controlled vocabulary are preferred, but other* ~various~ controlled vocabularies may be used *as long as the term is uniquely identified by an IRI. This term MAY be used to describe the content of a region of interest within an image.* ~AC-recommended vocabularies are preferred and MAY be unqualified literals (not a full URI). For terms from other vocabularies either a precise URI SHOULD be used, or, as long as all unqualified terms in all vocabularies are unique, metadata SHOULD provide the source vocabularies using the Subject Category Vocabulary term. The value SHOULD be a string, whose text can also be in the form of a URL.~ These guidelines on value format are less restrictive than is specified by the IPTC guidelines.\r\n~**Notes:** Recommended sets include: the NASA Global Change Master Directory (GCMD; http://gcmd.nasa.gov/), Subject Categories defined in Key to Nature (K2N; http://www.keytonature.eu/wiki/Subject_Category), the BioComplexity Thesaurus; https://www2.usgs.gov/core_science_systems/csas/biocomplexity_thesaurus/, the Description Type GBIF Vocabulary; http://rs.gbif.org/vocabulary/gbif/description_type.xml, the TDWG Species Profile Model; http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems.rdf, the Plinian Core; https://github.com/tdwg/PlinianCore/wiki, the European Environmental Agency GEneral Multilingual Environmental Thesaurus (GEMET; http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet), and the Long Term Ecological Research Network Controlled Vocabulary (LTER; http://vocab.lternet.edu/). The vocabulary may include major taxonomic groups (such as \"vertebrates\" or \"fungi\") or ecosystem terms (\"savannah\", \"temperate rain forest\", \"forest fires\", \"aquatic vertebrates\"). Other formal classifications (published in print or online) such as habitat, fuel, invasive species, agroproductivity, fisheries, migratory species etc. are also suitable.~\r\n**Type:** http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property\r\n\r\n**Term Name:** ac:subjectCategoryVocabulary\r\n**Label:** Subject Category Vocabulary\r\n**IRI:** http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/terms/subjectCategoryVocabulary\r\n**Required:** No\r\n**Repeatable:** ~Yes~ *No*\r\n**Definition:** Any *controlled* vocabulary ~or formal classification~ from which *values for ac:CVterm* ~terms in the Subject Category~ have been drawn.\r\n**Usage:** The value SHOULD be a stable URL for the vocabulary if one is available.\r\n**Notes:** *If controlled string values for ac:CVterm are taken from the Audubon Core Subject Category controlled vocabulary, it is not necessary to provide a value for this property. If pipe separated strings are used to provide multiple values for ac:CVterm, this term MUST NOT be repeated. It MAY be repeated if data structuring allows particular ac:CVterm string values to be associated with particular values for this term.* ~The AC recommended vocabularies do not need to be cited here.

{"prompt": "3D terms Proposal: new dc:type term and new ac terms", "completion": "The 3D Task groups is proposing the addition of a new `dc:type` term \"3D Digital Resource\" and two AC terms `ac:3DResourceType` and `ac:captureModality` (definition linked below), with the following rationale:\r\n\r\n## Proposed vocabulary and term additions.\r\nWe propose a vocabulary addition to dc:type. Specifically the word \"3D Resource\" or \"3D Digital Resource\" is needed as 3D resources are a class unto themselves not strictly fitting under the definition of any other words: e.g., \"data\" or \"image\" are not sufficient as justified below.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we propose two Audubon Core terms with controlled vocabularies to qualify and categorize the nature of a given 3D resource: **ac:3DResourceType** and **ac:captureModality**.\r\n\r\n## Why not an existing dc or ac term?\r\nExisting terms dc:type and ac:subtype use controlled vocabularies that do not allow adequate categorization and description of 3D resources.  The proposed terms are also contrasted with definitions for dc:format and ac:resourceCreationTechnique, which are similarly limited. Our justification for adding new fields to more easily distinguish among the variety of 3D resource types is as follows:\r\n\r\n[`dc:type`](https://ac.tdwg.org/termlist/#dc_type)\r\nTwo of the DCMI Type Vocabulary terms used in dc:type, \u201cImage\u201d and \u201cDataset\u201d, fit some, but not all, 3D resource types.\r\n- The definition of \u201cImage\u201d (http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Image) allows for a broad range of \u201cvisual representations\u201d currently, but this can misrepresent 3D resources. For example, raw CT scan data or constructed 3D models and other 3D resource types can be visually rendered, but they also consist of spatial and structural information that is not strictly visual.  \r\n- The definition of \u201cDataset\u201d (http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Dataset) would not technically misrepresent most 3D resources as \u201cdata in a defined structure\u201d, but for many scientific communities it could misrepresent a 3D reconstruction as raw \u201creality capture data\u201d when it is instead something more interpreted or created. \u201cDataset\u201d may also be too broad or unconventional for resource-users and providers to find or label 3D-specific datasets in useful ways.\r\n\r\n[`ac:subtype`](https://ac.tdwg.org/termlist/#ac_subtype)\r\n- Alternatively, a new word for 3D resources (e.g., \"3D Resource\" or \"3D Digital Resource\") could be added to the ac:subtype controlled vocabulary (https://ac.tdwg.org/subtype/). The issue here is that there is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between any given dc:type and all 3D resources. Therefore this would result in 3D Resource subtypes dis-aggregated under different type classes. It would be better to keep them all at the same level.\r\n\r\n[`dc:format`](https://ac.tdwg.org/termlist/#dc_format)\r\n- The definition for dc:format (http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/format) and controlled vocabulary within Audubon Core (https://ac.tdwg.org/format/) capture the file extension, which does not always reflect the encoding of a file\u2019s contents in a technical or more qualitative sense.  For example, a ZIP file may contain a CT dataset or Photogrammetry image file set.  The issue is common to video and audio file formats as well \u2013 e.g., the video content in an MP4 file needs to be encoded/decoded using one of a variety of codecs: h.264, MPEG-4, Apple ProRes 422, etc.\r\n\r\n[`ac:resourceCreationTechnique`](https://ac.tdwg.org/termlist/#ac_resourceCreationTechnique)\r\n- The purpose of this term is more flexible or verbose description of the steps in the resource\u2019s creation process, rather than a controlled vocabulary to describe how the resource\u2019s contents are encoded.\r\n\r\n\r\n## New Term Details\r\n\r\n**`ac:3DResourceType`**\r\n- The type of file or the way the 3D information is encoded. It is not the same as format.  An example of a type would be \u201cmesh\u201d which could be saved in a variety formats (.ply, .obj, .glb, etc.). Neither is \u201ctype\u201d redundant with \u201cmodality\u201d. Mesh files can be produced by a variety of modalities. Uses SKOS concept in RDF (see linked proposed ontology above).\r\n\r\n**`ac:captureModality`**\r\n- The imaging/sensor and technology used to generate a 3D resource. Uses SKOS concept in RDF (see linked proposed ontology above).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Term Notes:\r\n- [New AC Terms Proposal-v2.docx](https://docs.google.com/document/d/138Kf5xFyOjpaFuD4YQFE9fJKB5eHgqwj/edit#heading=h.avw8v8sm7c0d) - proposed ac:3DResourceType definition in the **Terms communicating file type and imaging modality** section:\r\n  - *Currently, ac:subtype has a controlled vocabulary specifying a variety of resources.  We propose the addition of \u201cDigital 3D Resource\u201d to the list of terms.  There are a variety of Digital 3d Resources created in a variety of ways as discussed above.  We propose two terms with controlled vocabularies to specify this information. \u201c3D Resource Type\u201d and \u201cImage Capture Modality\u201d.\r\n  - Specifically we are planning to handle information on \u201c3D Resource Type\u201d and 3D data \u201cImage Capture Modality\u201d with hierarchical SKOS concepts in RDF: https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/intro. Proposed ontologies are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J_B2cfGAm_l29SCGXse5Dy-op5dEb8xtJealKp2bcqY/edit).\r\n\r\n- [Task Group Notes from 2022-1-27](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xnNQ665vcxIoJrUXO9GSGZ-oxOgE5dRVEUFkZHf0lqo/edit#heading=h.pwwd34hr1dcc)\r\n  - *In Audubon Core, formatting can use the MIME type or file extension, which is kind of dicey as the file extension is not enough to define the file types. This might not be this group\u2019s problem, but there is an issue where Audubon Core says the file extension defines the file type, but the 3D work we are explicitly saying that this is not the case (there is a separate format and file extension field) - See page 5 in New AC terms proposal-v2.docx - Google Docs - I.

The proximate context was sets of images from camera traps (\"sequences\" = bursts that are grouped together because they occurred within the same 120 seconds), but there are other use cases. For example: images of the same specimen, label images that should be linked to images the specimens themselves (#200), slices of a 3D CT scan, etc. \r\n\r\nThis is also related to the issue raised at https://github.com/gbif/portal16/issues/1570#issuecomment-952207604, which involves the problem of linking related images in IIIF manifests. \r\n\r\nThis is probably an issue that needs to be addressed if we revise the [Structure document](http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/doc/structure/) as we discussed as a possible priority for 2022. That needs to happen anyway now that the ROI proposal is complete."}
{"prompt": "Term needed to designate when an image or ROI is a label", "completion": "This came up in assembling the use cases for the Views TG, but was determined to be out of scope for that group. However, there is a need for it and it is related to the new work on Regions Of Interest since an ROI could be flagged as label and not part of an organism."}
{"prompt": "How do we link media items to occurrence records?", "completion": "Currently Audubon Core has `ac:associatedObservationReference` and `ac:associatedSpecimenReference` to link a media item to observations and specimens. However, occurrences can be considered as distinct from specimens and observations (as forms of evidence) and may have different identifiers (occurrenceID vs. specimenID for example). So is there a term missing for linking a media item specifically to an occurrenceID?\r\n\r\nThere are also cases where an occurrence is documented specifically by a media item without any other form of evidence (e.g. camera trap). What term would be used to make those kind of links?\r\n\r\nWe should look at the XML schema for the AC IPTC extension to see what term (if any) is used to indicate the \"foreign key\" in the extension table that makes the link to the occurrence record in the core table. That relationship is the one we are talking about here."}
